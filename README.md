# Pyhton-cell-counting-project

This project is an automated cell counting software developed in Python. The goal is to analyze biological images such as bacterial colonies and other types of microbiological images.

To achieve this, I used image processing techniques to segment and quantify cells. Among the techniques used are region growing segmentation, thresholding segmentation, and watershed segmentation.

The libraries I used include matplotlib, numpy, scikit-image, and tkinter.

Upon running the script, a graphical user interface (GUI) opens for image selection and analysis. The "Select Image" button allows users to browse and choose the image to analyze. Subsequently, three methods are offered, allowing you to compare different methods for your analysis.

This fictional software provides an accessible solution for cell counting, reducing errors and the time required for analysis by healthcare professionals.
